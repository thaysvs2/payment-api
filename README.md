Payment API
This is a back-end RESTful API developed with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to simulate a simplified payment system. The project implements core functionalities like user and shopkeeper management, secure money transfers, external service integration for transaction authorization and notifications, and a robust testing suite.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

PostgreSQL (database server)

DBeaver or pgAdmin (database client tool)

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thaysvs2/payment-api.git
cd payment-api

2. Set up the Python Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv enviroment

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\enviroment\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source enviroment/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables. These are used for database connection and configuring the notification services. The Twilio service is optional and can be enabled via the NOTIFIERS variable.

# PostgreSQL database connection string
# Format: postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
DB_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/your_database_name"

# Notifiers to be used (separate multiple services with a comma)
# Options: log, mock, twilio
NOTIFIERS="log, mock, twilio"

# Twilio account details (only required if "twilio" is in NOTIFIERS)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"

# Database connection string
DB_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name"

# Twilio account details
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
MEU_NUMERO="your_verified_phone_number"

5. Create the Database Tables
Connect to your PostgreSQL database using DBeaver or pgAdmin and execute the following SQL commands to create the project's tables.

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    cpf_cnpj VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    phone VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id INT NOT NULL,
    destination_id INT NOT NULL,
    value DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (destination_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

6. Run the Application
You can start the API server using Uvicorn. The --reload flag enables auto-reloading on code changes.

uvicorn main:app --reload

The API documentation will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

main.py: The main application entry point, defining all API endpoints and business logic.

database/: Contains the connection.py module for database management, including SQLAlchemy models and helper functions.

test_main.py: Contains unit tests for the API endpoints using pytest and FastAPI TestClient.

.env: Environment variables file.

requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.

üß™ Running Tests
The project includes a robust suite of unit tests to ensure all business logic is working correctly.

# Run all tests
pytest

‚úÖ Implemented Features
User and Shopkeeper Models: Differentiates between two user types.

Unique Constraints: Enforces unique CPF/CNPJ and email addresses.

Money Transfer Logic: Allows money transfer between users and to shopkeepers.

Lojista Restrictions: Prevents shopkeepers from initiating transfers.

Balance Validation: Checks for sufficient balance before a transaction.

External Service Integration: Integrates with mock services for transaction authorization and payment notifications.

Atomic Transactions: Ensures that all database operations within a transaction are completed or rolled back in case of an error.

RESTful API: Provides a clean and well-structured API using FastAPI.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

FastAPI: High-performance, easy-to-use API framework.

SQLAlchemy: Powerful Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

psycopg2: PostgreSQL driver for Python.

Twilio: Third-party service for sending SMS notifications.

python-dotenv: Manages environment variables.

Pytest: Framework for writing and running tests.

httpx: The recommended library for making HTTP requests with FastAPI's TestClient.
